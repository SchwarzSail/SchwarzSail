# Hi there!👋

- I’m a undergraduate student from Fuzhou University, majoying in Computer Science.💻

- My primary programming language is Go, and I enjoy diving deep into topics like distributed systems, consensus algorithms (like Raft), and data structures. Currently, I’m working on projects called MIT-6.5840.👨‍💻

- I’m always up for a challenge and love solving complex problems.

- My next big step is diving into Artificial Intelligence🤖, where I’m excited to explore the potential of it.

- I'm also a member of west2-online. Welcome everyone who is fascinated by programming to join us!!!🍺
